#### Motivation
During the "Vue3: explorando o framework" course at the Alura programming school, I gained solid knowledge and deepened my understanding of the Vue.js 3 front-end framework. As part of this learning, I developed the project "Alura Tracker," an activity tracker daily. After completing the course, I took the project forward, implementing improvements to improve both the application and my own knowledge.

Here are some of the improvements I implemented:
 - Inversion of the order of the task list.
 - Added remove task functionality.
 - Inclusion of the option to change the application language (English, Portuguese and Spanish).
 - Added the ability to save tasks to local storage.
 - Introduced the ability to keep dark mode saved to local storage.
 - Implemented retention of selected language in local storage.
 - Possibility for users to export their tasks in CSV format.
 - Aesthetic improvement of the button that activates dark mode.

These improvements aim to make "Alura Tracker" a more effective and user-friendly tool, providing users with a more pleasant and functional experience.
